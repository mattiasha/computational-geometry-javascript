# Simple random polygon
## Two peasants

The two peasants algorithm creates a simple 'random' polygon. The idea of the algorithm
is to first generate a random point set, divide the set into an upper and lower set,
and then connect the upper/lower set from left-to-right/right-to-left correspondingly.
